Deploy your plugin
******************

Once you decide that your plugin is ready for distribution, build the final version of the plugin using the ``oneagent_build_plugin`` tool.

.. rubric:: Important considerations

Please note when distributing custom plugins:

* The plugin directories require at least read permissions for the appropriate user [1]_.
* If you're unsure how the plugins are loaded, and if you've copied them to the right place,
  learn more at :doc:`../plugin_lifecycle/index` in the "Plugin loading" section.
* Make sure that a plugin is built on the same OS platform as the plugin is going to be deployed. For example: 
    * If your plugin is going to be deployed on 32-bit Linux machine it has to be built on 32-bit Linux machine using 32-bit Python 3.6 interpreter,
    * If your plugin is going to be deployed on 64-bit Windows machine it has to be built on 64-bit Windows machine using 64-bit Python 3.6 interpreter,
    * etc.
