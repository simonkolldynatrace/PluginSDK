Extend your plugin
******************

In this section you'll enhance a plugin that was described in the :doc:`first tutorial <../readme>` by adding
new capabilities to the plugin, including a way to :doc:`pass configuration <demo_plugin_conf>` from Dynatrace Cluster Node and an approach to more graceful :doc:`error handling <error_handling>`.

Please note, the concepts built upon in this section are explained in detail in previous sections. If you're just
setting out on your OneAgent custom plugins adventure, it's recommended that you first familiarize yourself with the content listed below in order:
